# Job_Posting_Text_Analytics
Tools for retrieving and analyzing job postings by key-words

Project by Bellarmine University MSA team for a semester project.

# Goals
This project is intended to programatically analyze series of online job postings to:
1) classify postings by type of work described in addition to just title
2) classify posts by requirements in posting text in addtion to just title
3) compare requirements in job postings to resume contents (if time permits)
4) identify common attributes (I.E. salary, contract length, knowledge requirements, etc) within classifications (if time permits)
5) compare postings from one company to postings from another for similar jobs (if time permits)

# From assignment description:

## Scenario
You and your team are junior members of a management consultancy

You have been asked by one of the principal consultants to demonstrate the firms capabilities around text mining

Each team will be accountable to managing a timeline and accomplish milestone goals during the semester

Its up to the team to determine who does what on the project, but you’ll provide a peer review of everyone’s effort.

Nick and Zain will be attending your presentation and will be helping to evaluate your performance.

You will not be able to start this project late in the se

## Requirements

The data you use must contain text data and you need to use the text data to build your solution to the problem.

You will need to use a database for some of the data organization for your datasets

Your group will need to meet with me outside of class a few times this semester to ensure (you are responsible for scheduling it!):
	-- you are on track to deliver the project
	--highlight any challenges you are having with the project

Its your job to determine which analytical approach you’ll use to solve the problem. (Supervised/Semi-supervised/Unsupervised methods)
 	
You will need to apply at minimum 4 different modeling techniques in the project. 

At least 2 modeling techniques you’ll need to evaluate model performance to determine which is better for your particular project.
	--You’ll need approval from me to make sure your solution adheres to the requirements.

## Deliverables Project Proposal
A Project Proposal (Due Date:  Monday October 23rd ) 

*A clear description of the problem you are trying to solve, 

*The data set you’ll use and how you’ll obtain it (such as APIs)

*A high level description of the analytic approach you’ll use to solve the problem. 

*Your intentions on how you’ll break up the work to complete the project

*Your biggest concerns about completing the project

## Deliverables Final
R & SQL code workflow (Ongoing due date – your code needs to be submitted in git as you develop your process):  

*APIs and loading and/or extracting data out of the database. 
*data preprocessing steps 
*modeling code and evaluation of model output
*any code that generates visualizations that you use (in R, not Tableau)

In addition, a readme styled guide that provides a high level workflow of your R code process to make it easier to understand the technical details of your approach and necessary libraries for running your code.

Some additional notes on your R & SQL code:

*Your code needs to be checked into git as you develop it.  I’ll know if you are making progress on project based on the code check-ins you make on git.
*Checking in code is good professional experience because you’ll need to do it in your future analytics career, and it’s a great way to roll back changes you make as you develop your process.
*Your code will not only be evaluated based on how well it works but also how easy it is for others to follow what you are doing in your coding steps.
*You are able to make any changes you need to make to make sure your processes are working up until the day of your presentation.

Technical Write Up (Due: December 5th, a week before presentation):

*This should be a technical focused write up that answers the technical questions about your approach.
*Focus less on giving the reasons why you chose your project and more on the details about what you did in your modeling approach.  
-- Include examples of things you tried that did not work
*Include the relevant model metrics and analytically support any conclusions that you have made based on the data in your project

Presentation (Due: December 12th):

*A large portion of your grade for the project will be presentation
*Be sure to explain why you chose your specific problem
*Focus equally on the business value of project with the quality of your technical approach
*Practice your presentation before you give it, and keep the presentation to the allotted amount of time
