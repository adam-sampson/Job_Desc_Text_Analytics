Examples of these applications include the development of satellite and other space-flight and airborne payloads, testing for high consequence military programs, nuclear weapon safety mechanisms, high reliability electronic products, telemetry and software systems, and data science and analytics. The Center is divided into four main competencies: Advanced Mechanical Design, Firing &amp; Embedded Systems, Hi-Reliability Electronic Products, and Data Systems Engineering.The successful applicant will join high performing technical teams in the Data Systems Engineering Group and will handle the design, development, qualification, and delivery of highly specialized hardware and software components and subsystems for national security applications. These systems must be designed to meet demanding performance specifications, offer extremely high reliability, enable integration and interfacing to complex host systems, and meet stringent survivability requirements in adverse environments. Successful candidates, depending on skills match and placement within the Data Systems Engineering Group, will have the opportunity to make meaningful contributions in a wide variety of disciplines including analog and digital design and development, embedded development for real-time systems, data processing and analysis to include image and signal processing applications, network and communications technology, trusted systems design and development, testing/fielding complex hardware and software systems, and exploratory data analytics and applied data science. Candidates will be exposed to a variety of hardware and software development environments and methodologies spanning traditional waterfall development and systems engineering to agile development processes.About Sandia Sandia National Laboratories is the nation-s premier science and engineering lab for national security and technology innovation, with teams of specialists focused on cutting-edge work in a broad array of areas.
