<p><br></p>
<p>Our team is working on building Azure Data Lake, the next generation Big Data platform for Azure that can hyper-scale compute and storage (hundreds of thousands of VMs of compute and exabytes of storage). The Big Data team within C+E also owns the Cosmos Big Data service which powers insights and analytics across all the services and products at Microsoft, and will be extending these technologies to build the next gen Big Data platform in the cloud. Our customer’s requirements push us to process exabytes of data without even breaking a sweat. The amount of exhaust from a platform with that scale of processing is enormous, and the insights and scenarios that we want to enable on top of that raw data are endless. For our customers to maintain control and compliance over their data, we are making a big bet on building platform features that enable Data Mapping, Data Lineage Analysis, and real-time evaluation of Gating Policies that allow for better data-driven decisions to be made by the enterprises that stake their reputation on top of us.    <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We need engineers who care deeply about our customers and want to build services in way that empowers our customers, while ensuring compliance and privacy, to help build strong trust. We are not satisfied with the status quo. We want to go beyond the standard types of logs and telemetry that are typically made available to cloud service customers by delivering rich and actionable insights to customers in a way that also drives up our bottom line - increasing adoption and revenue. We are looking for candidates who want to apply cutting edge ideas around machine learning, trend detection, outlier analysis, predictive models, and other advanced data mining techniques to deliver these insights in near real time. We also work closely with an applied research team that specializes in these techniques - a chance for you to productize cutting-edge algorithms and ideas from the research community. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are looking for talented Senior Engineers, who have strong track record of success and background in large scale distributed systems. Experience in billing, monitoring, telemetry, and service analytics is a plus. Everyone on the team owns significant areas and directly contributes to the vision, direction, implementation, and ultimately the success of our products. You will collaborate on and negotiate your designs across our partner engineering teams and work closely with our PMs to design, build, and maintain an extensible and self-serve telemetry service that will lay the foundation for both internal and external customers    <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What’s in it for you?     <br></p>
<p>-     Work on the biggest of the big data services in Microsoft - you will be delivering end-customer features that will deliver new capabilities to both internal and external customers who depend on us to run their business.        <br></p>
<p>-     Live the services culture:    Embrace and learn in a fast paced, live-site focused environment -delivering customer value with everything we do.        <br></p>
<p>-     The opportunity to work in a world class engineering team with a senior team of engineers, architects, and leadership; a set of peers and mentors that will help you grow your career on the fast track.<br></p>
<p>-     Ultimately, help pave a bright future for the Big Data platform and the people who need it to solve big problems    <br></p>
