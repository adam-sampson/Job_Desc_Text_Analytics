MCIO is responsible for delivering and managing the physical infrastructure that supports over 200 Microsoft online services around the world. Our scope includes hardware deployment and maintenance, critical environment services, security and compliance, incident management, and Data Centre partner/vendor management. <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Increasing demand for Microsoft Cloud Services across Europe, means that we now need to recruit a strong team of Data Centre professionals to support multiple facilities in region.

The DCPM will work closely with the Microsoft appointed operational partners and vendors to deliver best in class services to our online Cloud services customers. As such, the DCPM will act as the on-site Microsoft representative and will provide guidance and direction on all Microsoft Data Centre policies, procedures, and operational requirements.<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Role &amp; Responsibilities<br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The DCPM will report to the Data Centre Operations Manager (DCOM) and will be responsible for the following functions at the Data Centre:<br></p>

<p>• The DCPM will act as the single point of contact for incidents at their Data Centre that impact Microsoft cloud services and the proactive and timely resolution of such incidents. This will require close partnership with landlords and internal support teams. This may also require occasional site attendance outside of normal working hours depending on the severity of the incident.<br></p>
<p>• The DCPM will be responsible for implementing and overseeing all security and compliance policies for their Data Centre. This will include engagement with the Data Centre Landlord and vendor support teams to ensure all local systems meet the Microsoft requirements set down by OSSC (Microsoft internal security and compliance team). All of the above may be subject to routine industry audits and the DCPM will be expected to assist in the preparation for and hosting of these audits.<br></p>
