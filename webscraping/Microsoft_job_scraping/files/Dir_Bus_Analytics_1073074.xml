<p><br></p>
<p>The digital shift is changing industries and reinventing how commercial businesses work and deliver value to their customers. Microsoft is positioned to help every customer embrace the digital revolution, with the breadth of our portfolio from devices to cloud services, and breakthrough innovation from mixed reality to artificial intelligence.    We also can provide many of these advanced capabilities to our own sales teams. Within the Worldwide Commercial Business, the Strategy and Business Analytics (SBA) team leads our commercial strategy work.    <br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Advanced &amp; Behavioral Analytics team, within SBA, is a key part of this effort.    This is a new and growing team that will consist of highly analytical professionals, with a goal of driving growth by arming our Worldwide Commercial Business leaders and Microsoft Sales teams with valuable insights through predictive analytics and business Intelligence.    This allows them to rapidly identify and seize opportunities, optimize seller efficiency, grow new business, and increase usage and consumption with customers. The Advanced &amp; Behavioral Analytics team is a project-based org and is looking for a highly motivated individual to play the role of Business Consultant.    <br></p>

This individual should be able to speak intelligently on all of the solution areas to help drive projects in these areas.    It will be critical that you play a leadership role and take ownership of directing the analytics engine within the team to find insights and work with key stakeholders to turn these insights into actionable recommendations.        <br></p>
