<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">Imagine what you could do here. At Apple, great ideas have a way of becoming great products, services, and customer experiences very quickly. 

Apple is leading the charge in high performance mobile computing with state of the ART SOC's announced with each of its revolutionary new product offerings.  At the core of all Apple mobile SOC's, is an on-chip system interconnect bus that supplies the SOC agents with their requested load and store data from on chip and off chip memories.  With every generation the max bandwidth, lowest latency, lowest area, and lowest power requirements are more stringent and require complex planning in order to achieve on Apple's schedules.

Be part of the team creating the architecture and design for the on-chip system interconnect bus for next generation Apple SOC's.
