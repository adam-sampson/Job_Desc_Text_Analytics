<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">Apple’s GPU Software team provides the graphics software foundation across all of Apple's innovative products, including iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, and Apple Watch.  Our responsibilities encompass the frameworks, developer tools, and device drivers for the GPU and Display on all of Apple’s hardware.

This team recently announced Metal 2 which provides near-direct access to the graphics processing unit (GPU), enabling you to maximize the graphics and compute potential of apps on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Building upon an efficient low-overhead architecture with precompiled shaders, fine-grained resource control, and multithreading support, Metal 2 further boosts performance by enabling the GPU to take more control of the rendering pipeline.  Moving beyond just graphics, Metal 2 provides deep support for GPU-accelerated machine learning and offers enhanced developer tools that make it even easier to debug, optimize, and deploy Metal apps. On Mac, Metal 2 adds support for virtual reality (VR) rendering and external GPUs, and provides new APIs and optimizations to help developers embrace these emerging technologies within their apps. 

Description
GPUSW's Metal Ecosystem team is now seeking a top-notch, driven, and dedicated engineer to work with developers to integrate and optimize Metal into their iOS and macOS applications. This team is tasked with engaging developers to enhance their success using Apple’s tools and technologies related to Metal.
Responsibilities 
- Analyze developers products and report on their use of the Metal API, recommending optimizations, algorithms, and techniques to improve their applications; 
- Host developers during in-person engineering sessions;
- Be a resource for all aspects of Metal application development, including engineering, documentation, training, and relationship management
