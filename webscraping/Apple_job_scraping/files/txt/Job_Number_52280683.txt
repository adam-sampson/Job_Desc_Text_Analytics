 ASIC Design Integration Engineer Job Number: 52280683 Santa Clara Valley, California, United States Posted: Oct. 2, 2017 Weekly Hours: 40.00 Job Summary Imagine what you could do here. At Apple, great ideas have a way of becoming great products and customer experiences very quickly. Bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish. The industry is accustomed to Apple taping out the SOC’s for our various products at a rigorous pace. In order to achieve this, Apple’s world class design and integration processes are driven by top notch integration engineers who own various blocks of the chip and coordinate with various teams to get all changes released to the database and production synthesized on the project scheduled delivery dates. This is a high visibility and mission critical role and requires close working relationships with many groups and an organized approach to coordinate all tasks in parallel to hit schedules consistently with a quality design. Key Qualifications This position requires thorough knowledge of the ASIC design flow, FE and Design verification, synthesis, scripting and netlist generation. The ideal candidate will have the following background At least 10+ years experience in ASIC design flow Proven track record of high performance designs in high volume production for low power applications Proven track record of RTL design and timing closure on large complex designs Expertise in: SOC IP integration and RTL Design for performance, low area, and low power FE production synthesis with DFT insertion ASIC design flow and netlist flow checks - CDC, Logical Equivalence UPF flow for power islands as well as voltage islands Design interfacing to PD for floorplanning and timing closure Strong communication skills are a must as the candidate will interface with a lot of different groups within and outside the company Self starter, highly motivated, highly organized, and schedule driven is a must Familiarity with DFT and backend related methodology and tools is a plus Description You will be responsible for the following: Own all aspects of development design for large SOC blocks including: Internal and external IP integration, design of system bus and control bus logic for connectivity of IP blocks to main SOC infrastructure, ownership of the Integration Spec for the design project, integration and optimization of any memories and hard macros required for the block, run synthesis, netlist generation, and timing closure for the block Work closely with Chip Architecture, Design verification, Physical Design, DFT, and power teams to achieve first tapeout success on designs Develop and maintain methodology/flows/checks for your design Work with multi-disciplinary groups to make sure designs are delivered on time and with highest quality by incorporating proper checks at every stage of the design process Education MS/PhD in a relevant area
