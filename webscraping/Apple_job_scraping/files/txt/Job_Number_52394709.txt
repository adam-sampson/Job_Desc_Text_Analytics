 Performance Model Development and Analysis Job Number: 52394709 Santa Clara Valley, California, United States Posted: Sep. 26, 2017 Weekly Hours: 40.00 Job Summary In this highly visible role, you will be a member of an performance model development effort interfacing with many disciplines, with a critical impact on future architectural performance improvements and power savings. Key Qualifications • Strong problem solving and analytical skills • Strong SW skills with good understanding of modular object oriented software development • Knowledge of C/C++, Python, Lua, Perl preferred • Outstanding written and verbal communications • Excellent collaboration skills • Proficiency in computer/SoC architecture and performance trade-offs • Knowledge of Verilog and/or VHDL and experience with simulators and waveform debugging tools • Model development and analysis experience preferred • Ability to conduct experiments in all phases of design, gathering and analyzing data; and utilize scripting/spread sheet to document and present the results. * The ideal candidate will have 5+ years relevant experience. Description As a performance model developer for the IP blocks you will have responsibilities spanning all aspects of SOC performance and power trade offs: • Working with Platform Architecture, SOC Microarchitecture, and design teams to plan and implement a high level performance model. The performance model is minimal feature set to meet the model requirements yet modular and flexible enough to be adapted for new projects and experiments. • Running trade off analysis for different options • Providing early feedback to the design team regarding the design choices that may have been made. • Developing and verifying tunable design configurations to maximize performance and minimize power. • Correlating performance model against the RTL implementation to verify accuracy. Education BS/MS in EE/CS is required
