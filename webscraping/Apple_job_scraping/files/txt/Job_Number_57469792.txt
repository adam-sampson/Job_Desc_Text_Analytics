 HID Sensor Algorithm Engineer Job Number: 57469792 Santa Clara Valley, California, United States Posted: May. 4, 2017 Weekly Hours: 40.00 Job Summary Be part of the engineering team that turns new forms of sensor signal processing into the next-generation human interfaces for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Macs and more. We are an eclectic group with backgrounds in signal and image processing, statistics, machine learning, controls, physics, neuroscience and human factors. We seek engineers who work well in cross-disciplinary teams over a full product cycle. You will be responsible for inventing algorithm concepts for research prototypes as well as implementing and polishing these into insanely great products. Key Qualifications Algorithm development in areas such as pattern or gesture recognition, adaptive filters, machine learning, sensor image processing or controls C/C++ coding and a mathematical modeling language (e.g. Matlab or python) User studies and data analysis (a plus) User interface design, graphics programming, or linguistic modeling (a plus) Description This is a key position at a focal point for HW/SW/UI integration. Starting from early in the product lifecycle, this engineer will analyze seemingly intractable sensing challenges, propose new algorithm architectures, implement user facing features and validate their effectiveness for a large population. Must have strong programming skills in functional and mathematical modeling languages, preferably familiar with embedded programming and machine learning. Any user interface design or graphics programming skills will broaden your role and effectiveness in this position. Education PhD in EECS/CS/CE/ME/Math/Physics
