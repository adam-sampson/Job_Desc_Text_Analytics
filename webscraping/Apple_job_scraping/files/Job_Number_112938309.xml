<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="preline">You will have responsibilities spanning a broad range of mechanical engineering disciplines. You will be contributing to multiple design projects with contending priorities and different timescales; no two work days will be the same in this role. Here are a few of the things you’ll be responsible for:
•Designing innovative new hardware (HW) test jigs &amp; fixtures for our state of the art acoustic test facilities, to support the dynamic development of audio transducer designs and audio system HW technologies.
•Drafting detailed CAD, along with high-complexity tolerance analysis of precision mechanical designs.
•Authoring all supporting documentation to assist with fixture usability and scalability.
•Gathering, managing, and analyzing large data sets, to validate and support your technical design decisions. 
•Conducting cross-functional design reviews and driving DfM/DfA processes for your designs.
•Researching and recommending suitable manufacturing techniques and materials for tooling, jigs and fixtures, for both low volume (in the lab) and high volume (at a contract manufacturing facility) production quantities.
•Building strong working relationships across the company, as we develop, evolve and improve metrology capabilities and assembly processes related to audio technology investigations.
