<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">We are seeking an enthusiastic team player to join our small, supportive, inclusive, and dynamic team as a 3D Data Visualization Scientist. The Data Visualization (DataViz) team collaborates with a variety of partners within Apple to distill data into actionable and intuitive visualizations that drive informed decisions.

We work cooperatively to understand challenging problems that arise during all stages of product design at Apple. The job requires collaborative work, programming skills, some knowledge of processing, modeling, and analyzing 3D images, and most importantly, a passion for creating informative visualizations and presentations to communicate results to all levels of the company.

We are committed to professional development across all aspects of data visualization with mentorship and training opportunities both within and outside Apple. This includes, but is not limited to, providing team members opportunities to improve their skills in: graphic design, coding, visual arts, statistics, communication, and presentation.

We are looking for a thoughtful team player who is adaptable, creative, and design oriented. We encourage anyone who approaches problem solving with curiosity and imagination to apply. We value people with a desire to learn new skills and a mindset that challenging questions are opportunities for insight. 

The DataViz team enables data-driven decision making by developing and performing analysis, modeling, and visualization of unstructured data for engineering and research design teams. Our unique position within the organization allows us to assist other teams on a wide range of products designed at Apple. Each new product pushes the boundaries of design, requiring innovations in engineering, materials, manufacturing technologies, and methods for visualizing this information. Large amounts of unstructured data are collected from various sources during the research, design, engineering, and production processes, and an integral part of our work is to transform this data into actionable insights that will inform decision making for client services, operations, design, and product enhancement. The DataViz team works closely with many cross-functional teams and what we do impacts products used by millions of people worldwide.
