<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">We’re looking for a talented server engineer to help us build systems for learning from the activities of the crowd while preserving individual privacy.

In this role, you’ll implement novel machine learning algorithms, and deploy them in production at massive scale. These systems help us understand and improve Apple’s user experience, and are an important part of our strategic focus on privacy. You’ll work in a small and dynamic team, building new functionality and collaborating across groups. You’ll also participate in algorithm development, pushing the frontier of differential privacy and other forms of data privacy.

This position requires a broad set of software engineering skills, with particular focus on machine learning algorithms and distributed implementations. You should have experience deploying at least one large production system with a massive dataset or a web-scale user population. An understanding of data privacy and a deep respect for users are also key.
