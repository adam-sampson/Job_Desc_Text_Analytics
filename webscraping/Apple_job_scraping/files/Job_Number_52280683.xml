<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">Imagine what you could do here. At Apple, great ideas have a way of becoming great products and customer experiences very quickly. Bring passion and dedication to your job and there's no telling what you could accomplish. 
The industry is accustomed to Apple taping out the SOC’s for our various products at a rigorous pace.  In order to achieve this, Apple’s world class design and integration processes are driven by top notch integration engineers who own various blocks of the chip and coordinate with various teams to get all changes released to the database and production synthesized on the project scheduled delivery dates.  This is a high visibility and mission critical role and requires close working relationships with many groups and an organized approach to coordinate all tasks in parallel to hit schedules consistently with a quality design.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="preline">You will be responsible for the following:

Own all aspects of development design for large SOC blocks including: Internal and external IP integration, design of system bus and control bus logic for connectivity of IP blocks to main SOC infrastructure, ownership of the Integration Spec for the design project, integration and optimization of any memories and hard macros required for the block,  run synthesis, netlist generation, and timing closure for the block 

Work closely with Chip Architecture, Design verification, Physical Design, DFT, and power teams to achieve first tapeout success on designs

Develop and maintain methodology/flows/checks for your design

Work with multi-disciplinary groups to make sure designs are delivered on time and with highest quality by incorporating proper checks at every stage of the design process
