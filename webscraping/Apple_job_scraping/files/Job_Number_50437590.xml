<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="preline">You'll be part of a small, talented and motivated team that operates like a startup within Apple. When software breaks, you will ensure it gets fixed by getting the right information to the right person. Sometimes that will mean trying to reproduce a reported problem yourself. Sometimes it will mean working with the reporter. But you won’t just wait for bugs to show up - you’ll actively look for problems before they’re reported and write automated regression tests. You’ll be exposed to our early prototypes and your feedback will help shape them into to something that will be used by millions of people.
