<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">Apple Silicon Engineering is seeking creative engineers to design the next generation of analog &amp; mixed-signal (AMS) circuits for Apple’s world-leading systems-on-chip (SOCs). Apple’s Ax SOCs are the brain of every iPhone and iPad.  Our AMS circuits connect them to the physical world.  Examples include SERDES for data communication, PLLs for clock generation, and sensors for measuring all sorts of physical quantities.  </p>
