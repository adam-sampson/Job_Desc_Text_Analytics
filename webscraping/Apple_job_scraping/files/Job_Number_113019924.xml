<h3>Description</h3>
<p class="preline">Responsible for ideation, concept development, and scaling of an enterprise data automation system with specific focus on data visualization for the visualization of manufacturing metrics and product related KPIs in the manufacturing of Apple products. Perform research and development on new technologies necessary to solve complex visualization tasks that have a direct impact to the quality and delivery of Apple products.

•Lead the development of a compelling enterprise-grade data visualization platform to effectively visualize process and product data
•Develop new and or improved data visualization methods through the application of theoretical and practical data visualization methods
•Proof-of-concept dashboards and data visuals for a wide range of visualization needs
•Perform exploratory visualization on data sets towards the development of a a full-scale system 
•Assemble large data sets for analysis either through direct SQL-based querying or development of scripts and code-modules to collate distributed and disparate data sources
•Lead projects with hands-on analysis and modeling. Choose the right tool from a broad range of statistical/data mining/machine learning techniques and apply them to big data sets to solve business problems and support business decisions    
•Engage cross-functionally to frame complex, ambiguous problems, and figure out where and how advanced analytics tools can be applied with the biggest impact. Then collect data, build analytical models and make recommendations 
•Develops software components in Python, Java and/or C/C++/Obj-C towards roll-out of a data automation system (with the visualization platform a core piece of this architecture)
