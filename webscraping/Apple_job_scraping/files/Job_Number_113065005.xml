<h3>Job Summary</h3>
<p class="preline">The people here at Apple don’t just create products - they create the kind of wonder that’s revolutionized entire industries. It’s the diversity of those people and their ideas that inspires the innovation that runs through everything we do, from amazing technology to industry-leading environmental efforts. Join Apple, and help us leave the world better than we found it.

Apple works with a variety of “partners” who can add significant and differentiated value to our solution for education customers. The Apple Education team is looking for a partner program manager to develop, define, and drive a streamlined GTM framework with critical program metrics that will enable the company to identify, support and measure the efficacy of the Education Partner Program. This program needs rapid development and ongoing iteration/optimization to increase sales, expand reach and improve customer satisfaction in the dynamic K20 education marketplace. 

In this role you are responsible for collaborating with Education Partners as well as Apple’s sales and cross-functional leaders to develop a GTM implementation strategy for the field sales team. You will develop a scalable framework to manage both the long term and day-to-day enablement of the sales team. You will devise a data gathering and analysis strategy so Apple has a centralized and consistent way to measure the contribution to our business and the health across all partners in the program on a quarterly basis. This includes contractual obligations (if necessary), demand generation reporting, sales metrics, leading quarterly business reviews and executive readouts. You will ensure there is alignment across all program participants around program vision, strategic initiatives and daily activities.</p>
